Secure Password Encryption
==========================

Implementation of a secure SHA512-based password salting and hashing algorithm.

Safety against following attacks
-----------------------------
* code exposure
* encrpyted password exposure
* dictionary/rainbow attacks
* timing attacks (not done yet)

Safety against brute force attacks must be implemented at the app level.
